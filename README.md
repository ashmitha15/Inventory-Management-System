Description:
A hardware store consists of various products to raise a building and also other components required to design a house such as paints, cements, steel, locks, lights, wires, nails, etc. The store also consists of some agricultural products such as manures, fertilizers, etc. and other tools such as shovels, buckets, rods, cutters, etc. In the traditional system to maintain the stock in the store, the owners used spreadsheet or paper to calculate the stock count, price of the product, etc. Since there a lot of items to be maintained in the hardware store it was a tedious process and hence there is a need of a database to maintain the stock, which reduces the manual intervention thus reducing the errors and making it easy to take some important administrative decisions.
